# Calculator_app

- Assignment for Week-1
- Can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of any two real numbers
- Format for input(without parantheses): (num1)op(num2)
- num1 and num2 can be negative as well. So, for example -12--44 is also supported, and interpreted as (-12)-(-44).
- If the expression is invalid, nothing gets printed

## TODO for Future

- Write a good parsing and computing function to handle any type of expression, and make the app more consistent.
- Support more kind of operations
